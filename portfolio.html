So the thesis becomes, as AI starts writing more of the software (including cuda kernels) and new datacenters are being built everywhere, does this moat remain ? post Claude Opus ?

Growing revenue but stalling profit because trying to catch up with nvidia:

Benefiting recently from the demand driven increase in NAND and DRAM prices
Micron produces both DRAM and NAND flash memory, with a product portfolio heavily weighted toward DRAM

Very sensitive to boom-and-bust cycles of the semiconductor memory industry. Following the pandemic-era boom, consumer demand for personal computers (PCs) and smartphones dropped significantly in 2022. Due to overestimating demand, chipmakers and their customers were left with massive stockpiles of NAND and DRAM chips. This oversupply led to a "freefall" in memory prices. After that they refused to increase capacity in production in the AI cycle fearing a second fall. When that never happened, underprovisioning demand and very long build time of factories is causing a demand driven push of prices. In summary, high inertia sector sensitive to demand swings.

But as AI is showing no sign of slowing down, will this continue ? and for how long ? it depends on the speed of building factories compared to the growing needs in memory of AI</td><td><span class="star">★★★☆☆</span> (3)</td></tr>

A possible hedge play against Nvidia, as AMD and others catch up and eat away the profit margins, profit margins of the total supply chain might shift to ASML. As long as china does not catch up...</td><td><span class="star">★★★☆☆</span> (3)</td></tr>
